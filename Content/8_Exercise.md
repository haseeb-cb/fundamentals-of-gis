### Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

# Exercise 8: Building efficiency & grids

By Sara Todorovic & Tatu Leppämäki for USP-303 at the Helsinki University. 

*Updated by Rowan van der Kaaden* 

## OVERVIEW & PURPOSE

In this exercise your task is to **calculate building efficiency ratio on different spatial scales**. Efficiency ratios (e) describe the level of land use intensity on zoned city areas. The building efficiency ratio is calculated by **dividing the total floor area** of each story of a building (or buildings) **by the size of the piece of land the building is in**. The piece of land can be the real estate, a neighborhood, a city district or any specified area. This ratio can be used to identify areas which are urban (more efficient) from non-built (less efficient) areas. Conversely, “sparsity ratio” is the total area of all non-built features to the size of the piece of land. When calculating the building efficiency on a city district (or similar) scale, it depicts regional efficiency. When building efficiency is calculated on a property/plot scale it’s known as plot efficiency (see Table 1). During this exercise, you will discover the different forms and levels of urbanity in Helsinki.

![Table 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/master/Assets/8_Exercise/8_Exercise_diagram.png) *Table 1*

**The purpose of this exercise** is to get familiar with efficiency ratios and to understand how different spatial scales affect the apparent intensity of different phenomena (in our case building efficiency ratio). Simultaneously, we’re trying to analyze whether the building efficiency ratio is a sufficient indicator of urbanity.


## OBJECTIVES

1. Calculation of building efficiency ratio on a few different spatial scales
	
	- City district level (Helsinki ‘small areas’)
	- 250 m grid level
	- Optional: Real estate registry (or property) level

2. Composing at least two maps depicting building efficiency ratios on different spatial scales

3. Thinking about how altering the spatial scale affects a phenomenon depicted on a map
	
	- Be mindful of which efficiency ratio scoring (table 1) you use at different spatial scales when visualizing/interpreting the results.

## DATA USED/NEEDED

1. SeutuRAMAVA 2016 (zoning data of the Helsinki region)

	- Spatial scale is at city district (‘small area’) level

2. HSY’s SeutuCD building registry data 2013

	- Attribute data has been modified to protect the privacy of the inhabitants
	-  KERALA2-field has the total floor area (m2), use this field in the analysis!
		- (The original KERALA field also includes NoData -values, which will give you incorrect results – do not use that field. To save you some time, we have already created for you the KERALA2 field, where the original KERALA field’s values with 99999999 (or NoData) have been reassigned to be 0. So, use KERALA2, not KERALA.)

3. A 250-meter grid, which you will create (Plugin: MMQGIS)
	- Can be a grid of squares, diamonds or hexagons

4. Optional: HSY’s SeutuCD Real estate registry 2013
	- This data has been modified for privacy reasons

## COMPLETION

Work individually or in pairs. Complete the exercise and write a short reflection. Include the following:
1. At least two maps of building efficiency ratio on different spatial scales.
	- Remember: all maps should have a legend, a scale bar and a north arrow

2. Analysis of the maps, considering:
	-  What the maps tell of the urbanity within Helsinki
	-  What is omitted/revealed when switching spatial scales
	-  How well building efficiency ratio describes urbanity

## EXERCISE PHASES

### Getting familiar with the data

1. Download 8_Exercise_data.zip from the [Github repository](https://github.com/rowan8k/fundamentals-of-gis/tree/master/Data), save it in a folder for this exercise, and extract the contents from the zip.
Then explore the attribute tables to familiarize yourself with what sorts of data you actually have.
	1. The fields you want to focus on (total floor area, m2) are: 
		- kara_yht in the SeutuRAMAVA layer
		- KERALA2 in the Building registry layer
	2.  Have a look at the lowest and highest values and the different field names. We have for example ones that seem to refer to municipality (kunta), small area codes (kauposanro), and  small area names (nimi).

*TIP: When working with data that will probably contain values with umlauts (Å, Ä, Ö), change the encoding to e.g. UTF-8 already when adding your layers, so you won’t run into problems later. Choose UTF-8 in the Encoding dropdown menu and write UTF-8 into Encoding field.*

2. **You might want to have a background map to help you get your bearings.**
	1. Use QuickMapServices or XYZ tiles as we have done earlier

### Calculating regional efficiency

3. **Being familiar with the attribute data, now you’ll have to calculate the building efficiency ratios for each district in Helsinki using SeutuRAMAVA data.**
	1. Remember: **E = total floor area/total land area**
		- You know where to find the total floor area, but how to get the total land area?
		- 
	2. However, you might’ve noticed that the data covers the entire capital region – but only Helsinki is wanted. You can either:
		- First calculate the efficiency ratio for all small areas in SeutuRAMAVA, and after the calculations are complete, extract Helsinki’s districts, or
		- Select/clip Helsinki’s districts before any calculations are done.

*TIP 1: To help you in including the Helsinki small areas only – the municipalities have unique identifying codes. Helsinki’s municipality code is 091 (KUNTA-field).*

*TIP 2: You might also want to discard the empty outer sea region (called ALUEMERI in the NIMI field) to make mapping simpler (Hint: Manually select fields using the attribute table or use a tool like select or extract by expression)*

4. **After calculating the efficiency ratios, compose a map.**
	1. Which districts have the highest efficiency? What about the lowest?
	2. Why do these districts have high/low efficiency scores?

*TIP: Visualize the map using a similar logic as is found in Table 1 and use the same visualization style for all maps you compose.*

### Calculating efficiency in a 250m grid

5. Remember: Make sure your project and layers are all in the same coordinate system.

6. **There are many ways to create a grid in QGIS. We’re going to utilize a plugin called MMQGIS. Download and install it using the Plugin manager.**

7. **After installing MMQGIS, there should be a drop-down menu at the top of the QGIS window with the name MMQGIS:**
	1. *Create* > *Create Grid Layer*
		1.  Define whether you want your grid to consist of rectangles, diamonds or hexagons (Geometry Type)
		2. Define the size of a grid element (X Spacing, Y Spacing, Units). Remember that we want to have a 250-meter grid. *TIP: Check the units of your layers in the layer properties* 
		3. Use Helsinki municipality borders as Extent.
		4. Save the resulting grid layer on your computer with an informative name (e.g. Helsinki_grid_250m)

8. **To join the building registry data into the grid layer:**
	1. First export the building registry data to Geopackage file format. (The spatial join operation takes an eternity if the layer is in Shapefile format.)
	2. As usual, save your project and any temporary layers now (in case of crash).
	3. **Join Attributes by Location (summary).**
		1. Because you want to **join building data into the grid**, the grid will be your Base layer (or Input layer, depending on QGIS version), and the Geopackaged building data will be your Join layer.
		2. You want information based on where floor area spatially coincides with your grid elements – what is a good Geometric predicate for this?
		3. Remember which field in the buildings layer contains the floor area?
		4. You need the sum of floor area in each cell.
		5. Make sure the parameters are set correctly before running the algorithm.
		6. Hit Run. This might take a while if your computer is tired. Have a coffee.

9. **Calculate the building efficiency ratio for the grid using field calculator. You need the *area of each cell* for this calculation.**
	1. Remember to choose an appropriate output field type.

### Map visualization  

10. **Compose a map of the outcome**
	
	1. Categorize the results using Table 1 like in the previous map
		- Be critical when interpreting the efficiency values

--- 

### Optional challenge 1

11. Calculate the building efficiency ratio using SeutuCD Real estate registry and building registry datasets.

12. Compose a map of the outcome.

---

### Optional challenge 2

13. Create a heatmap visualization of either the building efficiency ratio grid data or/and real estate data.
	
	1. Create centroids out of efficiency grid or/and real estate registry data
		1. Tip: Vector > Geometry Tools > Centroids
	2. Create a heatmap (Tip: Heatmap (Kernel Density Estimation)) using the centroids
		1. Set Weight from field to your efficiency ratio field (found under Advanced Parameters)
		2. Try different radiuses (e.g. 500 m, 1000 m and 2000 m) and kernel shapes
			- How does altering these affect the outcome?
		3. If you happen to encounter an error, try to reduce the rows and columns values

14. Compose a map of the heatmap analysis
